Project Title:
Welcome to the Word Guessing Game!
----------------------------------
----------------------------------
Description:
This is a fun, simple user-oriented game. The main purpose of this game is for the program to choose a random secret word from a hidden word bank. The words in the word bank are completely random and vary different lengths. The player's goal is to guess letters or singular words in attempts to get the secret word that was chosen by the program. There are unlimited letter guesses, but only 3 chances to guess the actual word itself. The program will not tell you where the letters are located in the secret word. After each guess, the user will be show everything they have guessed already. The program ends simply when the player guesses the secret word or when they try to guess a word 3 times and gets it wrong on the 3rd try. The goal is the guess the secret word in the least amount of turns possible. The lower the score, the better the player did.
